# Prompt
The notion of elliptical anisotropy and the medium “anellipticity” plays an important
role in understanding time-domain P-wave signatures in VTI media. A few years ago
I received a letter from a former colleague saying that he had found an “overlooked”
condition for elliptical anisotropy: 

$$
\delta = -f / 2 = - (1 - V_{S0}^2 / V_{P0}^2) / 2
$${#eq-delta}

Analyze the phase velocities and polarizations of P- and SV-waves in TI media that 
satisfy this condition and find out whether such models are indeed elliptical in some sense.
Hint: After rewriting the above condition in terms of the stiffness coefficients, start
your investigation with the Christoffel equation and consider two cases corresponding
to $c_{11} > c_{55}$ (normal situation) and $c_{11} ≤ c_{55}$; you can assume that $c_{33} > c_{55}$.
It would be helpful to compute or sketch the polar slowness curves (i.e., the vertical cross-section
of the slowness surface) for both in-plane polarized modes.

# Simplification of @eq-delta

@eq-delta can be simplified using the Thomsen parameters defined in 
Analyzing the @eq-delta using the definition of Thomsen parameters defined by
@tsvankin2012seismic[Equations 1.44, 1.45, and 1.47]

$$
V_{P0} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{c_{33}}{\rho}}
$${#eq-vp0}

$$
V_{S0} \equiv \sqrt{\frac{c_{55}}{\rho}}
$${#eq-vs0}

$$
\delta \equiv \frac{(c_{13} + c_{55})^2 - (c_{33} - c_{55})^2}{2c_{33}(c_{33}-c_{55})}
$${#eq-delta2}

By first substituting @eq-vp0, @eq-vs0, and @eq-delta2 into @eq-delta and simplifying:

$$
\frac{(c_{13} + c_{55})^2 - (c_{33} - c_{55})^2}{2c_{33}(c_{33}-c_{55})} 
= - (1 - \frac{c_{55}}{\rho} / \frac{c_{33}}{\rho}) / 2
$$

$$
\frac{(c_{13} + c_{55})^2 - (c_{33} - c_{55})^2}{c_{33}(c_{33}-c_{55})} 
= - (1 - \frac{c_{55}}{c_{33}})
$$

$$
\frac{(c_{13} + c_{55})^2 - (c_{33} - c_{55})^2}{(c_{33}-c_{55})} 
= - (c_{33} - c_{55})
$$

$$
\frac{(c_{13} + c_{55})^2 - (c_{33} - c_{55})^2}{(c_{33}-c_{55})} 
= - (c_{33} - c_{55})
$$

$$
(c_{13} + c_{55})^2 - (c_{33} - c_{55})^2 = - (c_{33} - c_{55})^2
$$

$$
(c_{13} + c_{55})^2 = 0
$$

$$
c_{13} = -c_{55}
$${#eq-delta-simplified}

# Cristoffel Equation

The Christoffel equation for in-plane polarized phases in VTI media can be expressed by 
Equation 1.37 [@tsvankin2012seismic]:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
c_{11}sin^2 \theta + c_{55} cos^2 \theta - \rho V^2 & (c_{13}+c_{55})sin \theta cos \theta \\
(c_{13}+c_{55})sin \theta cos \theta & c_{55}sin^2 \theta + c_{33} cos^2 \theta - \rho V^2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
U_1\\
U_3
\end{bmatrix}
= 0
$${#eq-christoffel_base}

where $\theta$ is the in-plane angle measured from the symetry axis.

Substituting @eq-delta-simplified into @eq-christoffel_base:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
c_{11}sin^2 \theta + c_{55} cos^2 \theta - \rho V^2 & 0 \\
0 & c_{55}sin^2 \theta + c_{33} cos^2 \theta - \rho V^2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
U_1\\
U_3
\end{bmatrix}
= 0
$${#eq-christoffel_reduced}

Which clearly yields two solutions for $V$:

$$
\sqrt{\frac{c_{11}sin^2 \theta + c_{55} cos^2 \theta}{\rho}} = V_1
$${#eq-v1}

$$
\sqrt{\frac{c_{55}sin^2 \theta + c_{33} cos^2 \theta}{\rho}} = V_2
$${#eq-v2}

and the resulting polarization vectors are:

$$
\overrightarrow{U_1} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ 1
\end{bmatrix}
\\
,
\overrightarrow{U_2} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 0
\end{bmatrix}
$${#eq-polarization}

Which is interesting because the polarization vectors don't change with slowness direction!

Also, it is important to note that @eq-v1 and @eq-v2 are both real because $c_{11}$, $c_{33}$ and
$c_{55}$ are positive definite.
